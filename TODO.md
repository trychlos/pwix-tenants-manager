|    1 | 2024- 6-27 | effectStart and effectEnd are expected to be configured in pwix:validty package |
|      |            | should be able to get this configuration back instead of using hard coded values |
|      |            | (and do not ask to configure the same thing here a second time) |
|    2 | 2024- 6-28 | have a scheduled job which deletes tenants_e entities which do not have any tenants_r records |
|      |            | as a label - so a record - is supposed to be mandatory to save a tenant |
|    3 | 2024- 6-28 | same than #2 for tenants_r which do not have any tenants_e |
